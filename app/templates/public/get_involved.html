            <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
            <p>Are you interested in volunteering? Do you have tech skills and want to share those with the community? Do you have other skills that aren't necessarily tech skills that can still help? If so, we'd be happy to have you. There are no time commitments for volunteering. Volunteer as little or as much as you would like.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in volunteering for the first time, we will invite you to attend our next bi-monthly volunteer get together and training. This is an optional event for our existing volunteers, but we highly encourage everyone who volunteers to attend to meet new volunteers and socialize and get to know our other volunteers better.</p>
            <p>To keep our community safe and healthy we ask that all volunteers wear masks when attending in-person events. This helps make sure that we are not still contributing to the spread of COVID and other communicable diseases that are harmful and dangerous to our immunocompromised and disabled community members.</p>
            <p>Here is an overview of our opportunities:</p>

                            Not usually. If you volunteering at an in-person event, we will provide things like a computer and tools like screwdrivers, tweazers, canned air, and more unless you would like to bring your own. If you are working remote, you will need to use your own computer if one is needed. We don't use remote software, so you won't need to install anything on your computer. The computer is just nice for researching issues while working.
