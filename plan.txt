    Volunteer Application Form (Public)
        A public-facing page where prospective volunteers can apply by submitting their details (e.g., name, email, phone number, availability, and interests).
        This form doesn't create user accounts; it just saves the application data into a volunteer_applications table or similar.

    Admin Portal for Applications
        A protected route where admins can review applications.
        Admins can decide to accept or reject applications.

    Volunteer Account Creation (Admin-Only)
        When an application is approved, the admin creates a volunteer account by filling in necessary fields (like generating a username and password for the volunteer).
        Optionally, the system could send an email to the new volunteer with login credentials or instructions for setting up their account.

    Admin Review Routes:
